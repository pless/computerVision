Project 1:
Due: Monday September 15
Teaming: You must do this project yourself.

Please submit your blog post here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdwxPTHp_a1A3iIGpE5SyrRAwf5NgfL7_tHO2Ts372YWgFcyg/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=113271021017255380934

(This submission form will be re-used all semester, and in later projects may allow teaming.  
Even though the form allows teaming, for project 1, you must work alone).

You can make a blog for yourself and post pages from it via the GWU blog service: https://blogs.gwu.edu/, 
or use public services like github, wordpress, etc.  

The goal of this project is to experiment with existing vision models and see some of things that they can tell you about an image.  
You can pick any model (including free ones like Bard on Google, or CoPilot: https://copilot.microsoft.com/.

You should upload the images and questions about those images and see how the image does.  You can pick any topic you want, 
but the goal is to create a compelling "blog post" that has a little bit of a theme, and where you can draw some conclusion.  
I have found that the ideas that work the best tend to be very very focussed: "Can you recognize what spice something is just
by looking at the powder"?  "How blurry can a stopsign be and have it still be recognized".

Some good examples of blog posts from previous semesters:
https://blogs.gwu.edu/mahad-gul/2024/01/22/analyzing-game-screenshots/
https://abalyahya.wordpress.com/2024/01/24/handwritten-text-recognition-in-different-languages/

I'm looking for you to do something similar, and explore some facet of current models' ability to analyze images.  You can take this quite generally, or focus on something more specific.  
I really want to leave this up to you, but you could explore how it analyzes paintings in general, or cave paintings from 10,000 years 
ago, or video game screen captures.  Any domain is ok, but I want to see you find images and prompts where it answers some relevant 
question well, and some example images and prompts where it answers the questions poorly, and hypothesize why you think it makes those 
mistakes.

Your blog post should be something like "three screenfulls"
